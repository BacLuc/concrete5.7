#### Concrete5 is an open source content management system for publishing content on the Web.

Concrete5 was designed for ease of use, for users with a minimum of technical skills. Concrete5 features in-context editing (the ability to edit website content directly on the page, rather than in an administrative interface). Editable areas are defined in concrete5 templates which allow editors to insert 'blocks' of content. These can contain simple content (text and images) or have more complex functionality, for example image slideshows, comments systems, lists of files, maps etc. Further addons can be installed from the concrete5 Marketplace to extend the range of blocks available for insertion. Websites running concrete5 can be connected to the concrete5 website, allowing automatic upgrading of the core software and of any addons downloaded or purchased from the Marketplace.
